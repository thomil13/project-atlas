# Mind Yourself

Mind yourself is a website built to provide insight and advice to those dealing with mental health issues, their friends and family, as well as employers & managers, based on the personal experience of the author, who has had to deal with mental health issues himself.

It was created as part of Code Institute's GoStack 25 Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp and aims to demonstrate my skills with HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap to create a fully responsive mental health focused website.

## Design Statement

> A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

I was a blogger & content creator long before I even considered learning to code. As such, I approached this project with a view to making the content do as much of the talking as possible. Efforts were also taken to ensure the site aligns with my existing real-world blogs. Simplicity was the name of the game here, in order to allow the content to take center stage. White and green are the primary colors in order to create a calm atmosphere on the site, with only the emergency contact information in the footer breaking from this logic in order to convey the importance of the information there.
