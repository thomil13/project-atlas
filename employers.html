                    <p>Dealing with a team member or colleague who is battling with their mental health can be
                        challenging. Speaking from personal experience, many employers don't prepare their managers or
                        HR staff properly to deal with such a situation. Indeed, in many cases, they don't prepare them
                        at all, despite the fact that, as employers, they have a duty of care towards their employees.
                        Naturally, setting up a proper corporate mental health strategy would be the best way to set up
                        your managers to handle such situations,and the links below contain advice on how to go about
                        setting up said strategy. However, there are a number of steps that can be taken in its absence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Create a non-judgemental atmosphere</strong> - Being in a work environment creates
                        pressure on ist own,
                        simply due to the fact that an employee's livelihood tends to depend on their job. As such, they
                        may be scared to come forward. In such a situation, it is important to creat an environment
                        where it is made clear that employees can come forward without fear of repercussions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Encourage them to seek help</strong> - Mental Health can be a tricky subject to deal
                        with, so it is
                        important that employees dealing with mental health issues reach out to a professional. Many
                        companies will have an Employee Assistance Program, and I can personally attest to the
                        usefulness of such a program, so it's definitely worth referring them to said program, or their
                        GP
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Give them time and space</strong> - Mental Health issues are not like regular issues.
                        They don't go away
                        with a diagnosis and a medical procedure. As such, any affected employees will need time and
                        breathing space to get back on their feet. So it's important to give them that space and to
                        allow them to get their feet back under them.
