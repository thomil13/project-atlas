                        <p>This page is very personal for me. Over the last decade or so, my life has been turned inside
                            out in every regard. Starting in 2017, I lost my parents, who were also the only family
                            members I had left, my apartment and my job, all within a twelve-month period. I managed to
                            pick my life back up, find a new place to stay, and even managed to land a job that was, in
                            many respects, my dream job. However, the events of 2017 had left a mark, something not
                            helped by the 2020 pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns. The results were predictable. Over
                            the past few years, I lost interest in a lot of the things I used to enjoy, pushed away
                            friends and colleagues, withdrew into myself and tried to shut out the world. I could feel
                            myself beginning to spiral, but thought that a good night's sleep or a relaxing weekend
                            would fix the issue. Or maybe journaling. Or meditation. It didn't. Instead, I just became
                            more withdrawn, irritable, and depressed. Eventually, things got so bad that I had to quit
                            that dream job of 2019 that had since morphed into a nightmare for me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since then, things have changed. I've started seeing a therapist. I've started to reevaluate
                            how I look at things, and I've started dealing with the near decade of chaos in my life, as
                            well as the several decades of unprocessed trauma before then that also played into the
                            issue. Am I well? No, I don't believe so. There's always a new issue around the corner
                            waiting to tackle me. But I'm better than I was. And I'm working to get better every day. I
                            set up this site to help those out there who are fighting the same fight, pushing against
                            that invisible wall between them and others that seems gossamer thing but might as well be
                            lightyears across. I set it up to help those who are watching someone they care about, a
                            friend, family member or loved one, fight this seemingly ceaseless battle. And I set it up
                            for the managers and co-workers who are often forced to watch helplessly as a previously
                            great colleague and team member implodes. None of you are alone. Help is out there!</p>
